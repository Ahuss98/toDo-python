# toDo-python


for this project I will be creating a simple todo app in python, this will consist of 3 baisic files a main for the terminal inputs a todo file for the functions (which will be 5: load/save/add/list/delete) and a json file to hold the data of the todo app

# the todo function
- the load_tasks
    - 1. checks if a file containing saved tasks exists
    - 2. if it does, read and return the tasks from the file
    - 3. if not return an empty list
